      "question": "How many imaginary frequencies will a second order saddle point have?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "1",
        "b": "2",
        "c": "3",
        "d": "None of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "A second order saddle point is defined as a maximum along two coordinates and minimum along all other coordinates. A maximum along two coordinates will have two two negative eigen values after double derivative of the energy. Both of this eigen values will produce two imaginary frequencies."

      "question": "Which of the following is true?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Reactants and products are the only stationary points in SN2 reaction",
        "b": "Transition state is not a stationary point",
        "c": "Only the transition state is the stationary point",
        "d": "All reactants, products and transition states are stationary points"

      "explanations": {
        "d": "All states which produce 0 eigen values in their first derivative of energy are known as stationary points."

      "question": "The normal mode corresponding to the imaginary frequency in the transition state usually reflects the change in geometry in going from reactants to products.",
      "answers": {
        "a": "True",
        "b": "False"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The only imaginary frequency in the transition state will reflect the coordinate connecting the reactant and product. Any other imaginary frequency may correspond to transition state of a different reaction."

      "explanations": {
        "b": "Linear molecules have 3N-5 degrees of freedom, but at the transition state it will have one less degree of freedom, hence 3N-6."
