      "question": "How can you characterise a transition state from its frequency calculation?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It will have multiple negative frequency",
        "b": "It will have one negative frequency",
        "c": "It will one less mode of vibration",
        "d": "It will one more mode of vibration"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "A transition state will have one negative frequency due to negative force constant obtained from double derivative of its energy."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",

      "question": "Taking the example of SN2 reaction, which of the following is true?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The reactant has higher number of vibrational modes than transition state",
        "b": "The transition state has higher number of vibrational modes than both products and reactants",
        "c": "The transition state is more stable than both reactants and products",
        "d": "SN2 reaction is always exothermic"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "The transition state has higher number of atoms than both reactant and product and hence will have higher vibrational modes."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"

    {
      "question": "Which of the following statements regarding the use of catalysts is false?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Catalysts lower the energy of the transition state",
        "b": "Catalysts increase the proportion of molecules that possess sufficient energy to clear the activation energy barrier",
        "c": "Catalysts increase the number of reactions that can happen spontaneous",
        "d": "Catalysts provide an alternative reaction pathway from reactant to product"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Catalyst decrease the activation energy of the reaction, i.e lower the energy of the transition state, as its energy is the activation energy of the reaction."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"

      "question": "How many vibrational degrees of freedom will NH<sub>3</sub> have at its second order saddle point?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "6",
        "b": "5",
        "c": "4",
        "d": "7"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "Saddles points have lesser degrees of freedom than minimum energy structures, a second order saddle point will have two lesser vibrational degrees of freedom. For NH<sub>3</sub>, this stands as 3N-8 i.e. 4"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "difficulty": "advanced"
